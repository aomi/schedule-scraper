UVic Schedule Scraper
=====================

Use this program to find schedules for your courses!

While schedulecourses.com is out of commission, I thought I'd help out my fellow students with their
course scheduling needs. This program will find combinations of sections that work together without
conflicts on your timetable, and present you with the CRNs for easy registration when the time comes.

## How to use.

Simply download the `schedule_scraper.py` file and run it using Python 3. If you have it installed on
your system, it should be as simple as

```
$ python3 schedule_scraper.py
```

from wherever you've downloaded it to.

The program will then ask you to add some courses. Follow the prompts and happy scheduling!

## Get in touch.

Feel free to get in touch with me if you are having issues, but I cannot promise I'll be able to help.
This was written over the course of three or four bursts of manic typing in the last 48 hours; so there
are bound to be some bugs. I hope to iron that out over the next few days, but since the program is
in a useful state as-is, it won't be a priority for me.

You can also post a ticket on this GitHub page if you like.

## Contributions welcome.

Any programmers out there are welcome to improve the program! It is licensed under the GPL, so it is
free software. Feel free to remix and redistribute at your leisure subject to the license. If you make
a great change, please consider opening a pull request!

## Thanks!

I hope this program proves useful to you.
